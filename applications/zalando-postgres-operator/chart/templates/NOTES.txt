This chart installs both the Zalando PostgreSQL Operator and a PostgreSQL
server with a pre-configured database into the default namespace.

When connecting to the database, use the following settings:
    hostname: postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local
    database: database
    schema: schema
    username: user

The password can be found in the secret:
    user.postgresql.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do
... with the key "password".

The connection is encrypted with a certificate generated by the cert-manager.
Refer to the README.md on how to import the relevant CA.
